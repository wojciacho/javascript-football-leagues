# Javascript Small Project

## Vanilla Javascript

Simple project built in Vanilla Javascript. It is football leagues app.
In this project I used the fetch method to request data from a server.
* Server I used: https://rapidapi.com/GiulianoCrescimbeni/api/football98/

* IMPORTANT: This server has only 100 request/day.

In this app you can search by leagues the top 10 teams.

* Search box CSS code: https://codepen.io/aqib-hanief/pen/dwBQdy
